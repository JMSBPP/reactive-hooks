# Solution Specification: Reactive Cross-Chain Pool Monitoring and Arbitrage System

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the technical implementation of a reactive cross-chain pool system built on Uniswap v4 hooks and the Reactive Network. The solution
What we want is to enable developers the ability to create and deploy as many upgradaeble reactive componets as they might want

- User deploys a Hook, the Hook needs to inherit AbstractCallback.sol
- The Hook is role based and needs to allow governance roles to CRUD reactive plugins
- A reactive plugin is defined by an origina chain id, and a mapping of a list of events with the respective function call, the list of events can either be a simple mapping of one event map to a function call or a collection of events with one final call or batched calls
- The hook needs to be able to track all the reactive plugins and upgrade how each hook function function changes when a reactive plugn is CRUD
